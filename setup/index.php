Then, you will be taken to a page with multiple input boxes, in which you should enter your MYSQL Server, MYSQL Database, MYSQL Username, MYSQL password, and your administrator's account information (username, password, and email address). Before filling out this form, please ensure that the file "conf.php" (located in the main directory of the forums) is CHMOD 777.--> Please start the setup by changing the seven mySQL/administrator account questions at the top of the 'sql_submit.php' file. Once you have completed filling out that information, press "next", and you will be taken to another page, on which JBB will automatically install itself in your MYSQL database. Finally, you will be redirected to another page, which will tell you to delete the setup files after you press "finish." Afterwards, please change the values to your correct mySQL information in the conf.php file in the root directory of the forums.<BR><BR><FONT COLOR="red">NOTICE: Do not delete the setup files before you click the "finish" button!</FONT><BR><BR><FONT FACE="verdana">Thank you for choosing Jellybean's Bulletin Board, we hope that you enjoy it very much!</FONT></b>
